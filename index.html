              <p>Beyond custody and parenting time matters, we also assist families and minors with a variety of children’s rights issues. Our attorneys represent both parents and minors in cases where a child’s best interests are at issue.</p>
              <h4>Dedicated To Providing The Best Outcome For Children</h4>

              <p><strong>Adoptions:</strong> Making the decision to adopt a child can be very exciting, but it can also come along with numerous legal matters that must be addressed before an adoption is complete.  We can guide you through this process.</p>
              <p><strong>Neglect or abuse:</strong> When the neglect or abuse of a child occurs, a tense and complicated situation arises. At Rutkowski Law Firm, our attorneys handle such matters with great care and attention, striving to ensure that the child at issue is protected.</p>

              <p><strong>Parenting time:</strong> In all divorce cases, parenting time is established so that each parent knows how much time they will have with their children. When circumstances change, however, we provide representation throughout the process of modifying parenting time.</p>
              <p><strong>Child custody:</strong> Courts in Michigan recognize parenting time as a separate issue from child custody. Just as changing circumstances can lead to a request for modifying parenting time, such changes may also warrant a change of custody arrangements. Our attorneys represent parents who wish to have custody changed or desire to maintain an existing custody arrangement.</p>
